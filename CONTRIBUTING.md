You found this page. Maybe you will also find bugs or missing features. You can tell me about them in the GitHub [issues](https://github.com/felixbade/assistant/issues).

## Philosophy
- OpenAI has made the best chat AI API. This tools shall be the best human-interface for that.
- ”Getting started” UX is extremely important. It is the main filter for user base growth after marketing.
- User ergonomy is insanely valuable. If the tool makes power-users annoyed, they will find something else eventually.
- New features need a UI, which is distracting to core features. New features must be more valuable than the clutter and complexity they are adding. Even existing, carefully crafted features must be killed if their justification becomes non-obvious later on. It’s a bonsai tree. ✂️
- The user should be in control, not the platform.
- Let’s show the world just how much is possible with little.

## Feature requests
My goal is to make this app a fully equipped productivity tool, while keeping the UX and codebase super simple. The bigger the idea pool of new features, the better choices I can make when prioritizing development.
- Please explain **why** your feature would be useful for you. **What kind of problem would it solve?** A simple explanation is sufficient – even if the value of a new feature is obvious to you, it is not always obvious to me.

See [existing feature requests](https://github.com/felixbade/assistant/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement) for inspiration.

## Bug reports
I want to make this tool rock solid and ergonomic, but I can’t test all scenarios. The first step of fixing bugs is finding them, and the second is describing what the bug is about. You can do these without touching the code. The better your report, the more likely it is that I fix it quickly.

- Please explain how to reproduce the bug. I can’t fix it if I can’t observe it.
- Please explain how it behaves, and how you would expect it to behave. Again, it might be obvious to you, but...
- Some bugs are debatable, but in general, if it's a ”feature” that distracts you, it’s a bug.

See [existing bug reports](https://github.com/felixbade/assistant/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+) for inspiration.

If you are not sure whether your issue is a bug report or a feature request, don’t worry, I will add an adequate label (or just fix it).

## Pull requests
In general, I’m more interested in feature requests and bug reports than pull requests. My goal is not to add all possible features – rather, to curate a minimal, yet powerful feature set.

This might change later if I no longer have time to actively develop this project.

Feel free to make your own fork though!
